  <h3>1.1 - Who am I</h3>
  <p>"I'm just another echo in the void."</p>
  <h3>1.2 - Definition of Operational Security</h3>
  <p>By definition, operational security was derived from the military term procedural security, originated as a term that described strategies to prevent potential adversaries from discovering critical operations-related data. It is an analytical process that classifies information assets and determines the control required to provide these assets. You might wonder why I choose to write about both physical and digital operational security? The simplest answer is they're intertwined and can't be separated in my opinion. If you have one but not the other, it's just like you don't have any.</p>

  <h2>2 - Misinformation Warfare</h2>
  <h3>2.1 - Ancient Misinformation</h3>
  <p>Since the dawn of men, misinformation has been used as a weapon and the most effective one at that. If you are a bookworm like me, I suggest you read "The Art of War" by Sun Tzu. That book, even after thousands of years since it was written, has theories and practices that can be applied in the modern world. Why am I telling you this? Because we will kick this off with one of his quotes. Quote: Sun Tzu - "All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when we are able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must appear inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near."</p>
  <p>One of the most egregious examples of this takes us back to ancient Rome and to the very end of the Republic when almost a century of civil war, chaos, and political assassinations had led the Roman government to the brink of collapse. It was the time of the so-called Second Triumvirate. Around 2000 years ago, the Roman Republic was facing a civil war between Octavian, the adopted son of the great general Julius Caesar, and Mark Anthony, one of Caesar's most trusted commanders. To win the war, Octavian knew he had to have the public on his side. Winning important battles helped, but if the people didn't like him, he would not be a successful ruler. To get public backing, Octavian launched a fake news war against Mark Anthony. He claimed Anthony, who was having an affair with Cleopatra, the Egyptian Queen, didn't respect traditional Roman values like faithfulness and respect. Octavian also said he was unfit to hold office because he was always drunk. Octavian got his message to the public through poetry and short, snappy slogans printed on coins. Octavian eventually won the war and became the first Emperor of Rome, ruling for over 50 years. But, I digress, so let's get back to what you came here for. Today, it's much easier to conduct misinformation warfare than 2000 years ago, obviously. Now, to skip history lessons and move to the modern era, here is an example of misinformation. Markets that want to conduct an exit scam will usually disable withdrawals due to some technical problems on their end, meanwhile keeping deposits working while they siphon funds to some off-site wallet.</p>
  <h3>2.2 - How are you being tracked</h3>
  <p>In today's digital age, we are constantly being tracked. From our online activities to our physical movements, various entities are collecting data about us. Here are some common ways you might be tracked:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Internet Browsing: Your internet service provider (ISP), websites you visit, and online advertisers can track your browsing history, search queries, and the content you interact with.</li>
    <li>Social Media: Social media platforms collect vast amounts of personal data, including your likes, comments, shares, and connections. This information can be used to create detailed profiles about you.</li>
    <li>Location Tracking: Mobile devices with GPS capabilities track your location data, which can be used to determine your movements and habits. Apps and services that request access to your location can also collect this information.</li>
    <li>Cookies and Tracking Pixels: Websites often use cookies and tracking pixels to monitor your online behavior, track your visits, and serve targeted advertisements.</li>
    <li>Online Purchases: When you make purchases online, your transaction history, payment details, and shipping address are collected and stored by e-commerce platforms.</li>
    <li>Public Records and Data Brokers: Public records, such as property ownership and court records, are accessible to the public. Data brokers compile and sell personal information from various sources, including public records.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>2.3 - How to use misinformation in your favor</h3>
  <p>Misinformation can be a powerful tool if used strategically. Here are a few ways to utilize misinformation to your advantage:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Disinformation Campaigns: Spread false information to confuse or deceive your adversaries. This can be done through social media, fake news websites, or anonymous sources.</li>
    <li>Misdirection: Create a diversion by deliberately leaking false information or leading others to focus on a decoy while you carry out your actual plans.</li>
    <li>Manipulating Public Opinion: Influence public perception by disseminating misinformation that supports your agenda or undermines your opponents. This can be achieved through targeted messaging and social media manipulation.</li>
    <li>Psychological Operations: Use psychological techniques to exploit cognitive biases and manipulate individuals' beliefs and behaviors. Misinformation can be tailored to appeal to specific emotions or exploit existing divisions in society.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>However, it's important to note that using misinformation ethically and responsibly is crucial. Unchecked spread of false information can have severe consequences and harm innocent individuals.</p>
  <h3>2.4 - Compartmentalization</h3>
  <p>Compartmentalization is a key principle in operational security. It involves dividing information, tasks, and responsibilities into distinct compartments to minimize the risk of unauthorized access or compromise. By compartmentalizing information, even if one compartment is breached, the damage can be contained, and the overall security can be maintained.</p>
  <p>Compartmentalization can be applied in both physical and digital contexts. In physical security, it may involve restricted access areas, secure storage of sensitive documents, and a need-to-know basis for classified information. In digital security, it may include access controls, encrypted communication channels, and separating systems or networks based on their levels of sensitivity.</p>
  <h3>2.5 - Security is not convenient</h3>
  <p>Maintaining operational security requires effort and sacrifices. It often involves implementing security measures that may inconvenience individuals. This could include using strong and unique passwords, regularly updating software and firmware, enabling multi-factor authentication, and being cautious about sharing personal information online.</p>
  <p>While these measures may seem burdensome, they are necessary to protect against threats and maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information. It's important to prioritize security over convenience to safeguard both your personal and organizational interests.</p>
