  <h3>1.1 - Who am I</h3>
  <p>"I'm just another echo in the void."</p>
  <h3>1.2 - Definition of Operational Security</h3>
  <p>By definition, operational security was derived from the military term procedural security, originated as a term that described strategies to prevent potential adversaries from discovering critical operations-related data. It is an analytical process that classifies information assets and determines the control required to provide these assets. You might wonder why I choose to write about both physical and digital operational security? The simplest answer is they're intertwined and can't be separated in my opinion. If you have one but not the other, it's just like you don't have any.</p>
  <h2>2 - Misinformation Warfare</h2>
  <h3>2.1 - Ancient Misinformation</h3>
  <p>Since the dawn of men, misinformation has been used as a weapon and the most effective one at that. If you are a bookworm like me, I suggest you read "The Art of War" by Sun Tzu. That book, even after thousands of years since it was written, has theories and practices that can be applied in the modern world. Why am I telling you this? Because we will kick this off with one of his quotes. Quote: Sun Tzu - "All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when we are able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must appear inactive; when we are near, we must.

  <h3>2.1 - Ancient Misinformation</h3>
  <p>Since the dawn of men, misinformation has been used as a weapon and the most effective one at that. If you are a bookworm like me, I suggest you read "The Art of War" by Sun Tzu. That book, even after thousands of years since it was written, has theories and practices that can be applied in the modern world. Why am I telling you this? Because we will kick this off with one of his quotes. Quote: Sun Tzu - "All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when we are able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must appear inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near."</p>
  <h3>2.2 - How are you being tracked</h3>
  <p>In today's digital age, our every move is being tracked. From the moment we wake up and check our smartphones to the websites we visit, the purchases we make, and even our physical location, we leave a trail of data behind us. Companies, governments, and malicious actors can use this data to build profiles, track our behavior, and potentially exploit it for various purposes. This section will explore the different ways you can be tracked and steps you can take to mitigate the risks.</p>
  <h3>2.3 - How to use misinformation in your favor</h3>
  <p>Just as misinformation can be used as a weapon against you, you can also employ it to protect yourself and your information. This section will delve into techniques and strategies to use misinformation as a defensive measure, such as creating decoy data, spreading disinformation, and implementing counterintelligence tactics.</p>
  <h3>2.4 - Compartmentalization</h3>
  <p>Compartmentalization is a fundamental principle of operational security. It involves dividing information, tasks, and resources into isolated compartments to minimize the potential damage if one compartment is compromised. This section will explore the concept of compartmentalization and provide practical tips on how to implement it in your daily life to enhance your security.</p>
  <h3>2.5 - Security is not convenient</h3>
  <p>Security often requires trade-offs, and convenience is one of the first things to be sacrificed. This section will address the importance of prioritizing security over convenience and provide examples of how compromising security for convenience can lead to disastrous consequences.</p>
  <h2>3 - Physical Operational Security (D.U.M.B.)</h2>
  <h3>3.1 - Prime Examples of OPSEC Fails</h3>
  <p>This section will examine real-life examples of operational security failures, both historical and contemporary. By studying these failures, we can learn valuable lessons about the importance of maintaining physical security and the potential consequences of neglecting it.</p>
  <h3>3.2 - Inevitable Fuck Ups, Aftermath, and Clean-Up</h3>
  <p>No matter how well-prepared we are, mistakes and failures can still happen. This section will explore the aftermath of operational security failures, the steps to take for damage control, and the process of cleaning up the mess to minimize the impact on personal and organizational security.</p>
  <h3>3.3 - Countermeasures and Mitigation Strategies</h3>
  <p>In this section, we will delve into various countermeasures and mitigation strategies to protect physical security. These include surveillance detection, personal protection techniques, secure communications, and defensive driving, among others.</p>
