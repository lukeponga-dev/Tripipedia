      <h2>1.2 Definition of Operational Security</h2>
      <p>By definition, operational security was derived from the military term procedural security, originated as a term that described strategies to prevent potential adversaries from discovering critical operations-related data. It is an analytical process that classifies information assets and determines the control required to provide these assets. Operational security encompasses both physical and digital aspects, as they are intertwined and cannot be separated.</p>

    <h1>Tripipedia 2 - Misinformation Warfare (Digital)</h1>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>2.1 Ancient Misinformation</h2>
      <p>Since the dawn of men, misinformation has been used as a weapon and the most effective one at that. "All warfare is based on deception," as Sun Tzu said in "The Art of War." One of the most egregious examples of ancient misinformation takes us back to ancient Rome and the time of the Second Triumvirate.</p>

      <h2>2.2 How are you being tracked</h2>
      <p>In the dystopian society we live in today, surveillance is a major part of how governments keep the common folk in line. Entities such as government agencies, tech conglomerates, and data mining companies rely on various data points to track individuals. Some of the most common pieces of data used for tracking include names, IP addresses, browser fingerprints, email addresses, location, phone numbers, date of birth, stylometry, and facial recognition.</p>

      <h2>2.3 How to use misinformation in your favor</h2>
      <p>To make it harder for tracking entities, you can employ various techniques:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use aliases instead of your real name</li>
        <li>Mask your IP address using Tor, VPN, or proxies</li>
        <li>Use multiple browsers with different plugins to conceal your browser fingerprint</li>
        <li>Avoid linking your personal phone number to services</li>
        <li>Use multiple email addresses for different purposes</li>
        <li>Apply stylometry techniques to mask your true identity</li>
        <li>Make subtle changes to details to deceive</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2.4 Compartmentalization</h2>
      <p>Qubes OS is considered one of the most secure operating systems because it utilizes compartmentalization. Keeping things separate is crucial for avoiding tracking. Avoid mixing your online identities and practice compartmentalization in your digital life.</p>

      <h2>2.5 Security is not convenient</h2>
      <p>Implementing operational security measures can be inconvenient, but it's a necessary sacrifice. It requires time, effort, and discipline to protect your online presence and personal information. Remember, the cost of convenience is your privacy.</p>
