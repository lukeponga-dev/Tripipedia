    <h1>Tripipedia 1 - Introduction</h1>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>1.1 Who am I</h2>
      <p>"I'm just another echo in the void."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>1.2 Definition of Operational Security</h2>
      <p>By definition, operational security was derived from the military term procedural security, originated as a term that described strategies to prevent potential adversaries from discovering critical operations-related data. It is an analytical process that classifies information assets and determines the control required to provide these assets. Operational security encompasses both physical and digital aspects, as they are intertwined and cannot be separated.</p>

    <h1>Tripipedia 2 - Misinformation Warfare (Digital)</h1>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>2.1 Ancient Misinformation</h2>
      <p>Since the dawn of men, misinformation has been used as a weapon and the most effective one at that. "All warfare is based on deception," as Sun Tzu said in "The Art of War." One of the most egregious examples of ancient misinformation takes us back to ancient Rome and the time of the Second Triumvirate.</p>

      <h2>2.2 How are you being tracked</h2>
      <p>In the dystopian society we live in today, surveillance is a major part of how governments keep the common folk in line. Entities such as government agencies, tech conglomerates, and data mining companies rely on various data points to track individuals. Some of the most common pieces of data used for tracking include names, IP addresses, browser fingerprints, email addresses, location, phone numbers, date of birth, stylometry, and facial recognition.</p>
      <p>[...]</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>2.3 How to use misinformation in your favor</h2>
      <p>To make it harder for tracking entities, you can employ various techniques:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use aliases instead of your real name</li>
        <li>Mask your IP address using Tor, VPN, or proxies</li>
        <li>Use multiple browsers with different plugins to conceal your browser fingerprint</li>
        <li>Avoid linking your personal phone number to services</li>
        <li>Use multiple email addresses for different purposes</li>
        <li>Apply stylometry techniques to mask your true identity</li>
        <li>Make subtle changes to details to deceive</li>
      </ul>
      <p>[...]</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>2.4 Compartmentalization</h2>
      <p>Qubes OS is considered one of the most secure operating systems because it utilizes compartmentalization. Keeping things separate is crucial for avoiding tracking. Avoid mixing your online identities and practice compartmentalization in your digital life.</p>
      <p>[...]</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>2.5 Security is not convenient</h2>
      <p>Implementing operational security measures can be inconvenient, but it's a necessary sacrifice. It requires time, effort, and discipline to protect your online presence and personal information. Remember, the cost of convenience is your privacy.</p>
      <p>[...]</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>3 D.U.M.B. - Physical Operational Security</h2>
  <p>This part is about physical operational security and you might wonder what does D.U.M.B. stand for? It's quite simple, Deep Underground Military Bases. I used them as a reference for impenetrable buildings that your OPSEC should be. Because it doesn't matter how good your digital OPSEC is if your physical security is horrendous, and vice versa.</p>
      <p>Before I dive into this section, anyone who has a love for safe-cracking and lock-picking like me should definitely check out books written by Jayson Street called Dissecting the Hack: F0rb1dd3n Network and Dissecting the Hack: STARS (Security Threats Are Real). He does a quite good job of explaining the importance of both digital and physical security and the consequences of disregarding any of them.</p>
  <p>Also, The Complete Book of Locks and Locksmithing, Seventh Edition, and Master Locksmithing: An Expert's Guide are fun reads filled with a trove of information.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>What is Physical OPSEC?</h2>
  <p>Physical OPSEC, commonly referred to as analogue OPSEC, is about taking measures to protect yourself and your operations in the physical world. It involves practices such as securing your physical location, avoiding discussions about sensitive information, and minimizing the risk of being targeted or compromised.</p>
  <p>People often tend to disregard physical OPSEC as less important, but make no mistake, it is as important as digital OPSEC. Just like in the digital world, I can only give you suggestions and make you think, as every situation and threat model is different.</p>
  <p>Let's make an assumption that you're a dealer who prefers the old-fashioned way rather than using online markets. Here are some pieces of advice you might find useful:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Don't talk too much about your safe-house, the amount of product you have, or whether you're armed. Revealing such information can make you a target for abduction, torture, or even murder.</li>
    <li>Don't "shit where you eat" â€“ avoid selling drugs in your own neighborhood. It's generally considered bad practice. Move your business to a different location.</li>
    <li>Don't be friends with clients. You can't be friends with addicts. Addicts may cooperate with law enforcement if caught. Having an addict as a friend is a great way to ensure a long vacation at any correctional facility worldwide.</li>
    <li>Know when to give up. Trust your gut. If something feels wrong, it probably is. Stepping back isn't always a bad thing.</li>
    <li>Don't work with a "friend of a friend of a friend." They're probably undercover cops.</li>
    <li>Always have an exit plan. Whether it's a forged passport and cash for a quick getaway or having enough funds to hire the best lawyer in the city, having a plan is essential.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These are just a few things to keep an eye out for. There is a wealth of more advice for various professions, but if I keep going, I won't be able to finish on time. Just remember that anything can be broken into, hacked, lock-picked, or exploited.</p>
  <h3>3.1 Prime Examples of OPSEC Fails</h3>
  <p>Let's talk about some OPSEC fails to learn from others' mistakes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>DreadPirateRoberts (Ross Ulbricht): Among many stupid things he did were using a misconfigured CAPTCHA server for an extensive period, shipping contraband to his home address, advertising Silk Road on Shroomery using his own Gmail address, befriending a former undercover (corrupt) DEA agent who later extorted him for money, and keeping logs of all his conversations and detailed diary of his Silk Road adventures. But the most fatal mistake was him not being aware of his surroundings.</li>
    <li>Shiny Flakes (German Vendor): This 20-year-old created one of the biggest cocaine trafficking operations in Germany at the time. He stored everything in his bedroom, including drugs and vast amounts of money, and sent all his shipments from the same DHL outpost. He also stored critical information in plain text on an unencrypted drive.</li>
    <li>Sabu (Hector Xavier Monsegur): As part of LulzSEC, he forgot to use TOR to connect to an IRC server monitored by the FBI. They obtained his IP address and eventually arrested him. He cooperated with law enforcement, giving up his friends in exchange for a plea deal.</li>
    <li>nCux / BulbaCC / Track2 (Roman Seleznev, Russian Carder): Among many stupid things he did, he rented servers with an email address he used to open a PayPal account and then used that PayPal account to pay for his wife's flowers. He also traveled with his work laptop containing hundreds of thousands of credit cards. His password, "Ochko123," was guessed by law enforcement and led to his arrest.</li>
    <li>Willy Clock (Ryan Gustefson, Ugandan Counterfeiter): He reused the personal email he used to apply for US citizenship for a Facebook account used to sell counterfeit notes. He even uploaded his own picture to that account.</li>
    <li>FrenchMaid aka nob (DEA Agent from DRP case): He used his work laptop to extort Ross Ulbricht and moved the money to bank accounts under his own name in countries with less strict banking secrecy laws.</li>
    <li>Alexandre Cazes (AlphaBay Admin): He used a personal email address for AlphaBay password reset emails, kept all data stored in an unencrypted format on his device, and hosted AlphaBay servers in Quebec, Canada under his own name.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>3.2 - Inevitable Fuck Up, Aftermath, and Clean-up</h3>
  <p>This is the last chapter of this post, discussing the inevitable fuck up and what to do afterward. We are all human, which means sooner or later, you will make a mistake. Here's a recurring example of a fuck up and how you may proceed afterward:</p>
  <p>Controlled Delivery: If law enforcement seizes your order but allows the post to go ahead with delivering the parcel to catch you in the act, there are usually two outcomes. If you have several orders under your belt and it's taking suspiciously long for the parcel to be delivered, and it was stationed for days at the same place, you can either not know and sign for the package, getting busted within seconds, or you can deny receiving the package, in which case they have nothing.</p>
  <p>If you suspect it's a controlled delivery, the best course of action is to remove any evidence of such activity from your devices and your home, as the address is likely compromised. Purging evidence involves using data shredders to securely erase data, but if there's critical information that must never fall into enemy hands, it's best to get rid of the SSD/HDD in question by shredding the data (recommended is at least 7 passes) and destroying the disk, such as by burning it. The point is, if something feels wrong, it probably is. Be vigilant, avoid ordering to your home address, and play the game without letting the game play you.</p>
