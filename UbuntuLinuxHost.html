        <h1>Encrypted Ubuntu Linux Host</h1>
        <p>
          We have chosen Ubuntu 21.10 as our host operating system for all of
          our Tutorials - the reason being is that its the most widely supported
          Li nux OS that has drivers and firmware support for most devices.
          Other Linux Flavors are available but for the normal new Li nux user
          who wishes to not use Windows - This is by far the best way to go.
          There is nothing worse than installi ng a new Operating System only to
          find some of your devices do not work.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this Tutorial and for best NETSEC and OPSEC Practice. We are going
          to run the Host install from an External Encrypted Drive (SD / NvMe)
          are preferred as at any stage we can rip out the SD / NvMe and snap it
          in half or hit it with a hammer.
        </p>
        <p>
          What we will need for this tutorial is a Computer and 2 External
          Drives as noted above.
        </p>

        <li class="">
          Choose the method youd li ke to use (Direct Download or Torrent) - The
          preferred method of download is using the torrent option as it has a
          hash check which verifies the integrity of the .iso
        </li>
        <li class="">

      <h2>
        Now that you have your installation media created its time to boot from
        the drive:
      </h2>
      <h3>INSTALL UBUNTU:</h3>
      <ol class="list-group-item">
        <li class="">
          Reboot your machine and boot into the bios and turn off secure boot.
          We want to do this so that the install does not enroll a key into your
          bios.
        </li>
        <li class="">
          Usually the bios can be accessed by pressing the DEL / ESC / F2 Key
        </li>
        <li class="">
          Once that is done save and exit the Bios by pressing the F10 key and
          save the changes.
        </li>
        <li class="">
          As soon your machine reboots press the boot menu key so we can boot
          from the SD card we created. On most machines its F12 / F11 / F8 -
          Consult your computer brand for how to do this if none of them work.
        </li>
        <li class="">
          The Ubuntu boot menu will appear and you can select the first option
          and you should boot into li ve mode of the OS

        </li>
        <li class="">
          Next on the Updates and Software Screen you will have the option for
          Normal or Minimal Installation. Select Minimal
        </li>
        <li class="">
          Put a checkbox in both download updates and Install Third Party
          Software
        </li>
        <li class="">
          If you have a Configure secure boot checkbox then you know you have
          not disabled secure boot in the bios (quit the installation and reboot
          back into your bios in step 1)
        </li>
        <li class="">Next the installation type window will appear</li>
        <li class="">

          OK and then Continue
        </li>
        <li class="">
          You will now need to choose a password for your encryption to unlock
          your drive at boot. Enter a nice long passphrase that you will
          remember and cli ck Install Now
        </li>
        <li class="">
          Now you will have the option to select the disk you'd li ke to install
          onto. Select the second external drive that you had inserted at boot -
          MAKE SURE YOU SELECT THE CORRECT DRIVE..
        </li>
        <li class="">
          MAKE SURE YOU SELECT THE CORRECT DRIVE.. (yes!! check twice)

        <li class="">
          Once the installation has completed you will need to reboot your
          machine. Press the restart button and remove your installation media.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>BOOTING FOR THE FIRST TIME:</h3>
      <ol class="list-group-item">
        <li class="">
          Once the machine reboots press the F12 / F11 / F8 boot menu key and
          select your second external USB card.
        </li>
        <li class="">
          You will be prompted with a Decrypt Disk Passphrase prompt. Input the
          password you used in step 15 above and press enter.
        </li>
        <li class="">
          Your machine will boot and you will be presented with the login
          Screen.
        </li>
        <li class="">
          Login and you will then be presented with the desktop which will be
          your base for the remaining Li nux tutorials.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Famili arize yourself with the layout etc. You can navigate to the top
        left menu and go down to the Control Center where you can make changes
        to your settings and install additional drivers.
      </p>

      <p></p>
      <p>
        For the most part of using Li nux we are going to be using the command
        li ne a lot so a good idea is to add the Terminal Launcher to your top
        bar.
      </p>

      <h3>To do this:</h3>
      <ol class="list-group-item">
        <li class="">
          Cli ck on the Menu and select System Tools. You will see MATE terminal
          li sted.
        </li>
        <li class="">Select it and drag it to your top bar.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Once on the top bar. Cli ck it and type:</p>
      <ol>
        <li class="">sudo apt update</li>

        <li class="">sudo apt-dist upgrade -y</li>
        <li class="">sudo reboot -n</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Your machine will reboot and you will have a fresh clean O/S updated and
        ready to use.
