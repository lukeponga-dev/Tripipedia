        <h1>How To Clear Metadata From Images</h1>
        <p>Images that contain Exif metadata may reveal when and where a
            photo was taken and with what device, among other things. While
            this is usually a desirable feature, it can also be a privacy
            concern if the images are going to be shared or published
            online. Exif data also helps inflate file size. In this guide,
            well see how to remove EXIF data from JPG, JPEG, PNG, and other
            image files from the Linux command line. There are quite a few
            tools available that can remove Exif data, but one weve found to
            work very well is ExifTool. This program can strip Exif metadata
            without re-compressing the image, so theres no loss in quality.
            There are a variety of options that can be used with the
            program, such as exporting a new version of the image (without
            the Exif data) or simply re-saving the image in-place. Well show
            you all the most useful commands below.</p>
        <p>Downloading ExifTool</p>

        <p>You can download this program from the ExifTool website or use
            the appropriate command below to install it with your systems
            package manager.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Ubuntu, Debian, and Linux Mint, Whonix and Tails:</li>
            <code>sudo apt install libimage-exiftool-perl</code>
            <li>Fedora, AlmaLinux, CentOS, and RHEL:</li>
            <code>sudo dnf install perl-Image-ExifTool</code>
            <li>Arch Linux and Manjaro:</li>
            <code>sudo pacman -S perl-image-exiftool</code>
        </ul>

        <p>ExifTool Command Examples</p>

        <p>Once ExifTool has been installed, use some of the example
            commands below in order to remove Exif data. These commands
            assume that youve already changed directories to where your
            images files are saved.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>View all the metadata for an image file by using the
                following command.</li>
            <code>exiftool image.jpg</code>
            <li>Use the -all option to remove all metadata from a file. This
                command will save a new copy of your file, with the metadata
                removed. The original file will be renamed, with _original
                appended to the end of it.</li>
            <code>exiftool -all= image.jpg</code>
            <li>Use the -EXIF option to remove Exif data only from a file.</li>
            <code>exiftool -EXIF= image.jpg</code>
            <li>Use the -overwrite_original option to remove all metadata without saving backup files.</li>
            <code>exiftool -overwrite_original -all= image.jpg</code>
            <li>Use the -recurse option to instruct ExifTool to traverse sub-directories. Specify the name of the
                directory and itll clear metadata for every image file found inside.</li>
            <code>exiftool -recurse -all= images-folder</code>
            <li>Use a wildcard and the following options to clear all metadata for all images and those found inside
                subdirectories. If youre wary of using it, omit the -overwrite_original option.</li>
            <code>exiftool -overwrite_original -recurse -all= *</code>
            <li>To see all other options for ExifTool, check out its man page.</li>
            <code>man exiftool</code>
        </ol>
